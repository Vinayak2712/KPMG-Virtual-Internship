# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
The Data Analytics &amp; Visualization virtual experience programme by KPMG groups which includes -> Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, Data Insights and Presentation.

During my virtual internship at KPMG, I participated in the Data Analytics and Visualization virtual experience program, which offered an enriching and transformative learning experience. The program encompassed various aspects, including Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Data Presentation.

One of my key tasks during the internship involved addressing mistakes in an email sent to a client. I took the initiative to draft a mail seeking corrections, demonstrating strong communication skills and attention to detail. After receiving the corrected dataset, I proceeded to conduct data analysis using advanced analytical tools and techniques.

To effectively present the insights gained from the data analysis, I utilized Tableau to create dynamic and interactive dashboards. This allowed for a visually appealing and user-friendly representation of the data, facilitating better comprehension and decision-making for the client.

Overall, my virtual internship at KPMG provided invaluable hands-on experience in data analytics and visualization, enabling me to enhance my technical proficiency, communication abilities, and problem-solving skills. The exposure to real-world scenarios within a professional environment has significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth.
